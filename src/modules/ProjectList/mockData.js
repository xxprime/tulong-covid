      "OpenCrisisBoard is an open-source ready-to-deploy application that builds community resilience by letting users communicate on needs-focused message boards, such as Volunteering Services (Think grocery delivery for elderly) and other needs like Medication, Food & Water, Shelter, and more.",
      "The boards only allow for sign-ups via Facebook or Twitter accounts, and not anonymous or email-based accounts, avoiding the spread of misinformation by letting users easily vet the source of the information.",
      "The primary goal is for it to be a good source of important information for communities. The secondary goal is to connect users amongst questions and needs that government services currently does not account for, such as volunteer-based child care (in a safe way) as well as grocery delivery for elderly.",

      "Problem: The detection of COVID-19 symptoms requires doctor and hospital visits, or a visit to test sites outside from home. This results in possible transmission or infection of COVID-19, and an increase of doctor visits straining the medical resources available.",
      "Solution: Prognosis, diagnosis and screening for the patients infected with COVID-19 is suggested to be based on breathing characteristics (Wang et al. 2020. https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05534). The detection of breathing patterns can be achieved via facial cameras and machine learning (Chen et al. 2019 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03503.pdf).",
      "The proposed project is an app that can be installed and used on any smartphone and laptop to detect early symptoms of COVID-19 remotely without leaving the home. It uses the detection of breathing characteristics via technological devices accessible to everybody at home with cameras of smartphones/laptop and machine learning, and combines it with the detection of symptoms of breathing characteristics. The app could also include mindfulness and meditation exercises to help people reduce stress and anxiety. And resources to reach for the nearest hospital, doctor and pharmacy. As well as resources for communal support and connection to nearest online groups, help for grocery delivery etc.",
